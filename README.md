Many of us find it difficult to **search for a hospital** with desired facilities at the time of emergency. In a new city when we are looking for a hospital, we don’t know whether we are going to the correct place or just wasting time by visiting the hospital which doesn’t have sufficient beds, doctors, types of machinery, and other required facilities. It may happen that the nearer hospital doesn’t have a doctor or rooms, so rather than risking the life of the patient, it would be better to go to a hospital where there are hopes for saving the patient because time plays a vital role in such cases. Big 5 stars hospitals are not only the hospitals that can save someone’s life. It may happen a good hospital that is at a shorter distance in the nearby locality can save someone’s life rather than losing life while traveling a long distance for those 5-star hospitals. In India, a lot of precious time is been wasted while taking a heart attack patient, and **50% of them lose their life before reaching the hospital** [Read More](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-50-of-heart-attack-cases-reach-hospital-late-govt-data-shows/story-penFdsewgGwpIwiQnRDoLJ.html). 

So we have decided to make a mobile app that will not only help to **find the most appropriate hospital according to need** rather will also make the **process of admitting patients easy**. All major and minor hospitals will be listed with categories of all the updated facilities they provide and the current status of those facilities like the number of beds available, number of doctors available, medical check machines, and all other relevant details.

### Features
- To build a user-friendly and quick nearby hospital status showing app.
- Quick patient admitting and bed booking facilities.
- Live status of all the available facilities of the hospital.
- Facilities feedback review system.

### Constraints
- Non verified people will not be able to engage in any booking of the hospital room rather they can only see the live status of the facilities.

### App Glims
- Asset light strategy: We can link with hospitals that are near railway stations, bus stands, airports so that people in an emergency get help faster.
- Availability check: To make the app more accessible we will provide the hospitals with the facilities needed and we can also keep a check with sufficient supplies because all lives matter and during an emergency we can make sure that the hospital does not create a problem for patients and their families.
- Feedback Feedforward: In the app, people can rate their experience with the hospital so that we can keep a check whether the hospital staff is behaving properly with the patient and not harassing the family.  

### How to run it on Local System
- Fork the repository
- Open the command prompt in the folder where the project is saved
- In command prompt type `yarn start`
- Then go to your browser and search for `localhost:3000`
